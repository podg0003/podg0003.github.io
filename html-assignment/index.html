    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Elen Podgurski and I'm 19 years old and funnily I was born on April 1<sup>st</sup>. Some of my hobbies include reading books and partaking in various sorts of arts and crafts. I did try the <abbr title="Interactive Multimedia and Design">IMD</abbr> program at Carleton but it wasn't working for me since it was geared towards game development/animation.</p>
        <p>It was a difficult choice to make considering my parents are strong university advocates. My independent decision to switch from University to College was so <em>relieving</em>. I'm excited to gather my skills as a digital creator and head straight into the field of work. Here's a motivational quote that I really like:</p>
        <blockquote>“You've got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction.”</blockquote><cite>-George Lorimer</cite>
